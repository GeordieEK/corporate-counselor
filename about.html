        <p> Do you feel overwhelmed and helpless in the face of rapidly growing existential crises and soaring income inequality? Then Corporate Counselor is for you! A solutionist AI chatbot developed by Geordie Elliot-Kerr, using a <a href="https://dev.to/sylviapap/make-a-simple-chatbot-with-javascript-1gc">tutorial</a> by Sylvia Pap, Corporate Counselor is a neat and infuriating commentary on platform capitalism and the solutionist faux-ideals that drive it. </p>

        <p> Prompting you for your deepest worries and insecurities, Corporate Counselor will then attempt to sell you products or just flat out ignore you. It’s primitive, just like the destructive energy sources governments across the world continue to pour money into but if it wasn’t, it would harvest all your data in order to exploit you further and then some. It’s not really helpful, but it’s not supposed to be, it exists to raise the wealth of its shareholders and any other functionality is secondary, sound familiar? If it doesn’t already, it’s about to be a lot more omnipresent with the rise of AI-driven technologies and the gradual removal of regulations that govern digital counselling services. As if speaking to a real therapist wasn’t already a privilege reserved only for those who could afford it. </p>

        <p> Sure, any form of therapy might be beneficial, but do you really trust the same tech culture that brought you Instagram or Facebook to carefully consider the dangers of chatbot therapy when there’s obscene amounts of money to be made? The WHO estimates that wellness expenditures ($4.5 trillion) are more than half as large as total global health expenditures ($7.8 trillion). This explosion in capitalist wellness culture or ‘McMindfullness’ (Purser, 2019) intentionally weaponises our insecurities while remaining out of reach of most people. This prioritisation of money over sanity is something we are currently seeing in the 2021 Facebook whistleblower trials, with the company being acutely aware that fear and loathing sells ads like nothing else. </p> 

        <p> Luckily, for the billionaires and their conglomerates, these platforms act as convenient scapegoats for the real underlying issues. Any sort of change that increases well-being of the masses comes at great risk to the few that exploit them, so why actually change anything when you can just build an app that appears to do something and makes you money in the process? And if it doesn’t, blame the technology, rinse and repeat. </p>

        <p> It is important to note that any future AI counsellor that harvests your data won’t be simplistic like mine and look like some scam website. Instead, it will be incredibly slick, easy to use and infinitely more efficient at commodifying you, which gives it the potential to be that much more dangerous. </p>
